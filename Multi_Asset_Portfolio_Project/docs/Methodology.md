# Portfolio Optimization Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the mathematical foundations, optimization approach, and key assumptions underlying the Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization system. The methodology follows institutional best practices and incorporates modern portfolio theory with practical constraints.

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Mean-Variance Optimization

The core optimization problem follows Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory:

**Objective Function:**
```
Maximize: Sharpe Ratio = (μ_p - r_f) / σ_p
```

Where:
- μ_p = Portfolio expected return
- r_f = Risk-free rate
- σ_p = Portfolio volatility

**Portfolio Return:**
```
μ_p = Σ(w_i × μ_i)
```

**Portfolio Volatility:**
```
σ_p = √(Σ Σ w_i × w_j × σ_ij)
```

Where:
- w_i = Weight of asset i
- μ_i = Expected return of asset i
- σ_ij = Covariance between assets i and j

### 2. Optimization Constraints

#### Budget Constraint
```
Σ w_i = 1
```

#### Individual Asset Limits
```
0 ≤ w_i ≤ 0.40 (40% maximum per asset)
```

#### Concentration Limits
```
max(w_i) ≤ 0.30 (30% maximum concentration)
```

#### Alternatives Minimum
```
Σ w_alt ≥ 0.20 (20% minimum to alternatives)
```

#### ESG Constraint
```
Σ(w_i × ESG_i) / Σ w_i ≥ 7.0
```

### 3. Risk Management Framework

#### Value at Risk (VaR)
Historical simulation approach:
```
VaR_α = -Percentile(returns, 1-α)
```

#### Stress Testing
Scenario analysis for:
- 2008 Financial Crisis (2007-2009)
- COVID-19 Market Crash (2020)
- Interest Rate Shock (+200 bps)
- Custom worst-case scenarios

#### Factor Analysis
Linear regression model:
```
R_i = α_i + Σ(β_ik × F_k) + ε_i
```

Where:
- R_i = Asset return
- α_i = Alpha (excess return)
- β_ik = Factor loading
- F_k = Factor return
- ε_i = Residual

### 4. Transaction Cost Modeling

#### Rebalancing Costs
```
TC = Σ |w_new,i - w_old,i| × c_i
```

Where:
- c_i = Transaction cost for asset i (typically 10 bps)

#### Optimal Rebalancing
Balance between:
- Tracking error reduction
- Transaction cost minimization
- Liquidity constraints

## Data Processing Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
- **Frequency**: Monthly returns
- **Period**: 5 years of historical data
- **Assets**: 8 traditional + 2 simulated alternatives

### 2. Data Quality Checks
- Missing data handling (forward fill, max 10% missing)
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Correlation stability analysis
- Volatility clustering validation

### 3. Alternative Asset Simulation
Realistic simulation based on institutional characteristics:

**Hedge Funds:**
- Annual Return: 10%
- Annual Volatility: 15%
- Correlation with equities: 0.3-0.5

**Private Equity:**
- Annual Return: 12%
- Annual Volatility: 18%
- Correlation with equities: 0.4-0.6

## Performance Attribution

### 1. Return Decomposition
```
R_portfolio = Σ(w_i × R_i)
```

### 2. Risk Contribution
```
RC_i = w_i × ∂σ_p/∂w_i
```

### 3. Manager Evaluation Metrics
- Sharpe Ratio
- Alpha (excess return)
- Beta (market sensitivity)
- Maximum Drawdown
- Information Ratio
- Due Diligence Score

## ESG Integration

### 1. Scoring Methodology
- **Scale**: 1-10 (10 = highest ESG score)
- **Sources**: MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg
- **Coverage**: All asset classes with proxy scores for alternatives

### 2. Constraint Implementation
```
Portfolio ESG Score = Σ(w_i × ESG_i) / Σ w_i ≥ 7.0
```

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Backtesting Framework
- Out-of-sample testing
- Rolling window analysis
- Performance persistence validation

### 2. Stress Testing Scenarios
- Historical crisis periods
- Forward-looking scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis

### 3. Robustness Checks
- Parameter sensitivity
- Model stability
- Constraint relaxation analysis

## Key Assumptions

### 1. Market Assumptions
- Efficient market hypothesis (weak form)
- Normal distribution of returns (approximation)
- Stable correlation structure
- No arbitrage opportunities

### 2. Implementation Assumptions
- Transaction costs: 10 bps per trade
- Rebalancing frequency: Quarterly
- Liquidity: Sufficient for all assets
- No short selling constraints

### 3. Risk Assumptions
- Historical volatility as forward-looking proxy
- Constant risk-free rate: 2%
- No regime changes in correlation structure

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Model Limitations
- Assumes normal distribution of returns
- Static correlation assumption
- No regime-switching models
- Limited to linear relationships

### 2. Implementation Challenges
- Transaction cost estimation
- Liquidity constraints
- Market impact considerations
- Regulatory constraints

### 3. Future Enhancements
- Dynamic correlation models
- Regime-switching approaches
- Machine learning integration
- Real-time data feeds

## Conclusion

This methodology provides a robust foundation for institutional portfolio optimization while incorporating practical constraints and modern risk management techniques. The approach balances theoretical rigor with implementation feasibility, making it suitable for real-world portfolio management applications.
